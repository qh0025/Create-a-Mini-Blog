Basic Blog with User Name/Password Account Creation

Create a blog on a website that only allows registered users to make a post.  Users are allowed to create a post when their username and password is successfully matched in the database.  If users are not registered, they may do so by creating an account and the information will be stored in mySQL database for future login.  Users are also shown whether or not they are logged in and will have their username attached to their blog post.  Users can then log out.
